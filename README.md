# LATTICE GENOME

I am designing and implementing lattice genomes for exploratory studies into genome folding. As lattice genomes are computationally quite light, they are perfect for use in education (i.e. on older computers and not-so-powerful laptops).


# EXAMPLES

  python lattice_genome.py -c simple_config.json


# FUTURE WORK

Also known as the to-do list:

- Observers should be split up.
