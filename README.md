# LATTICE GENOME

We have been designing and implementing lattice genomes for exploratory studies into genome folding. As lattice genomes are computationally quite light, they are perfect for use in education (i.e. on older computers and not-so-powerful laptops).


## EXAMPLE USAGE

  python lattice_genome.py -c simple_config.json


## FUTURE WORK

Short-listed:

- Improve plotting time vs long range interactions

The long to-do list:

- Observers should be split up.
- Feedback between transcribed genomic regions and enhancers.
